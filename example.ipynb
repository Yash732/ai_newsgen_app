₹44,000 crore and smart metering projects of ₹13,600 crore, Adani said at an annual general meeting of shareholders of the group\\'s flagship company Adani Enterprises The infrastructure and utilities conglomerate recorded a 7 per cent rise in revenue to ₹2.72 lakh crore in FY25 while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) increased over 8 per cent to ₹89,806 crore.Adani reiterated the group\\'s capital expenditure plan of $15-$20 billion annually over the next five years. \"These are not just investments in our group, but investments in the possibilities for doing our part to build India\\'s infrastructure,\" he said.The group\\'s ports business-Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone-handled a record 450 metric million tonnes (mmt) cargo last fiscal year while Adani New Industries is set to open an integrated 10 GW solar module manufacturing facility by the next fiscal year.In the airports business, the company handled a record 94 million passengers while its greenfield airport in Navi Mumbai is set to start operations later this year with an initial capacity of 20 million passengers.Adani, though, termed the group\\'s Dharavi rehabilitation project as its most transformative.\"...our most transformative project is unfolding in Dharavi - Asia\\'s largest slum, now being reimagined as India\\'s most ambitious urban rehabilitation project,\" he said. \"And over 1 million people will move from narrow lanes to a township that will feature spacious layouts, dual toilets, open spaces, schools, hospitals, transit hubs and parks,\" he said.Adani also said the group\\'s governance is of global standards, referring to allegations from the US Department of Justice and the SEC. \"Despite all the noise, the facts are

After Swiggy\\'s $1.4-billion IPO last year, filed through the confidential mode, sailed through, a clutch of firms including PhysicsWallah, Groww, Boat, and Shiprocket have taken this route. Lenskart and Meesho are also headed this way, sources said.While traditional companies such as Vishal Mega Mart have opted for this mode, and recently, Tata Capital chose to go confidential, the trend is picking up among startups that operate in a competitive market.For one, a confidential filing allows startups to keep their business metrics and performance away from the public eye. It also gives them the leeway to test the market appetite and accordingly decide on the IPO timing. Startups that are still firming up their path to profitability find this approach to be more prudent, investment bankers said.\"The trend has been picked up by startups which are in very competitive businesses as it helps them to shield public disclosure of their KPIs and other sensitive business information like clients and vendors. This could also be useful in cases where issuers have a slightly longer time frame in mind for IPOs, yet want to get the regulatory clearance as Sebi observations are valid for an 18-month period in this route,\" Anurag Byas, director, equity markets solutions at Rothschild & Co, told TOI.The first batch of big startup IPOs was seen in 2021 when, fuelled by the pandemic-led surge in appetite for digital services, companies rushed to the markets to capitalise on consumer sentiment. Sebi introduced the confidential filing route in 2022.\"Companies facing intense market competition prefer shorter windows for narrative battles in the public square. Less time spent on information wars is better for companies focused on frenetic growth and execution,\" said an executive at an IPO-bound startup which took the confidential route on condition of anonymity.Zepto, PhonePe, Pine Labs, and Lenskart are among a spate of startups that are eyeing a public listing. In a volatile market, the option of confidential filing becomes more favoured. \"With global rate cycles and geopolitical risks keeping equity markets volatile, startups prefer to keep their listing ambitions discreet. This route allows them to stay prepared, monitor the sentiment, and hit the market quickly when windows open up,\" said Prakash Bulusu , joint CEO at IIFL Capital.The practice of confidential filing is in place in developed jurisdictions, and the adoption in India gives issuers greater flexibility, said Kailash Soni, head of India equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs.\"Companies are choosing

But even before the money is in the bank, the company has plans to spend more than half of it in just the next three months, the people said.Over the course of 2025, xAI, which is responsible for the AI-powered chatbot Grok, expects to burn through about $13 billion, as reflected in the company’s levered cash flow, according to details shared with investors. As a result, its prolific fundraising efforts are just barely keeping pace with expenses, the people added.A spokesperson for the company declined to comment. However, Musk said “Bloomberg is talking nonsense” in a response to a post on his social media platform X that referenced Bloomberg’s article.The losses are due, in part, to the huge costs that all AI companies face as they build the server farms and buy the specialized computer chips that are needed to train advanced AI models like Grok and ChatGPT. Carlyle Group Inc. estimates that over $1.8 trillion of capital will be deployed by 2030 to meet that demand to build out AI infrastructure , Chief Executive Officer Harvey Schwartz wrote in a shareholder letter.“Model builders will look to raise debt and they’re going to burn lots and lots of cash,” said Jordan Chalfin, senior analyst and head of technology at CreditSights. “The space is very competitive and they are battling for technical supremacy.”But Musk’s entrant in the AI race has struggled to develop revenue streams at the same rate as some of its direct competitors, like OpenAI and Anthropic.While almost none of these companies offer public figures on their finances, Bloomberg has previously reported that OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is expecting to bring in revenues of $12.7 billion this year. At xAI, revenues are expected to be just $500 million this year, rising to north of $2 billion next year, investors were recently told.Listen and subscribe to Elon, Inc. on Apple, Spotify, iHeart and the Bloomberg Terminal.What xAI has on its side is a CEO, Musk, who is the richest man in the world, and one who has shown a willingness to spend his fortune on huge, futuristic projects long before they start generating money. Back in 2017, Musk’s biggest company, Tesla Inc. was burning through $1 billion a quarter to pay for the production of its Model 3 car, Bloomberg reported at the time. SpaceX, meanwhile, sustained years of steady losses as it pushed toward its long-term goal of interplanetary exploration. Even against this backdrop, though, the huge losses at xAI stand out.Musk’s team at xAI, which is racing to develop AI that can compete with humans, believes that they have advantages that will eventually allow them to catch up with peers. While some competitors rent chips and server space, xAI is paying for much of the infrastructure itself and getting direct access through X, which previously bought a significant stockpile of the most coveted and high powered computer chips. Musk has said that he expects xAI will continue buying more chips.After recently merging with X, Musk’s AI executives are also hopeful that they will be able to train the company’s models on the social media network’s copious and constantly-refreshed archives, rather than paying for data sets like other AI companies.These potential advantages have led xAI to optimistically project that it will be profitable by 2027, people familiar with the matter said. OpenAI expects to be cashflow positive by 2029, Bloomberg previously reported.These projections, along with Musk’s celebrity status and political power, have been enough to win over many investors, especially before the recent breakdown in the relationship between Musk and President Donald Trump. Potential xAI investors were told that the company’s valuation grew to $80 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $51 billion at the end of 2024. Investors have included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and VY Capital.For now, though, xAI is racing to raise enough money to keep up with its prodigious expenditures. Between its founding in 2023 and June of this year, xAI raised $14 billion of equity, people briefed on the financials said. Of that, just $4 billion was left at the beginning of the first quarter, and the company expected to spend almost all of that remaining money in the second quarter, the people said.The company is now finalizing $4.3 billion in new equity funding, and it already has plans to raise another $6.4 billion of capital next year, the company has told investors. And that is on top of the $5 billion in debt that Bloomberg has previously reported Morgan Stanley is helping it raise. The corporate debt is expected to help pay for xAI’s data center development, the people said. Other companies have decided to do project financing instead.The company is also expecting to get a bit of help from a $650 million rebate from one of its manufacturers, it told investors this week.There were early signs that investors were hesitant to loan the company money at the proposed terms, Bloomberg has reported. The company gave select investors more detailed financial information on Monday in response to questions it had faced during the fundraising process, people familiar with the negotiations said. But the deal has attracted more interest since the company changed some of the deal terms — to be more investor friendly — and finalized the equity fundraising.A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley, the bank in charge of xAI’s debt sale, declined to comment.\", 'embedding':

The size of the stake wasn\\'t disclosed.The Bengaluru-based startup, which focuses on UPI payments, had raised $12 million from Incubate Fund India and Unilever Ventures last October.The investment gives Razorpay a foothold in consumer-internet business besides bolstering its play for direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands.ET first reported about the development on February 18. At the time, people said Pop was considering a $50 million valuation in the new round.Pop did not disclose the valuation at which the deal was finalised. \"In today\\'s crowded D2C space, brands need more than just payment solutions; they need tools to earn trust, drive repeat purchases, and build real loyalty. Pop bridges that gap,\" said Harshil Mathur, chief executive officer, Razorpay.The investment in Pop tracks Razorpay\\'s acquisition of PoshVine, a loyalty and rewards management platform.Razorpay Engage, an intelligent marketing growth suite, was built on top of that platform.In a statement, Pop said it will use the funding proceeds to strengthen its product platform, invest in Popcoins-led rewards, and accelerate merchant partnerships across D2C and lifestyle categories.Founded by former Flipkart senior executive Bhargav Errangi, Poptech Growth which runs Pop, uses rewards on UPI payments as a customer acquisition tool. The company also offers a credit card powered by Yes Bank to customers.While the startup wants to leverage payments to acquire new customers, it also competes with heavily-funded players like Cred, Navi and Super.Money. Each of these players have been investing in marketing and promotional campaigns to grow their UPI business.According to data from the National Payments Corporation of India, Pop processed 13.5 million transactions in May settling Rs 500 crore.

Angel investors, including Meta board member Charles Songhurst, Sarvam AI CEO Vivek Raghavan, and Satya Vas, have also backed the company in the round.Repello defends generative AI (GenAI) systems by using its products to simulate real-world attacks to find vulnerabilities and provide next steps for mitigation and safeguarding.Established in 2024 by IIT Roorkee alumni Aryaman Behera and Naman Mishra, Repello\\'s engineering, product, and R&D teams are based in Bengaluru, while sales and marketing verticals are in San Francisco. The company plans to use the funding to accelerate product development and expand the platform\\'s red teaming and threat intelligence capabilities and to scale its go-to-market efforts, Behera told ET.\"We are also working on strategic partnerships and integrations to fuel the company\\'s growth,\" he said.Behera affirmed the startup\\'s belief in a proactive stance to cybersecurity, rather than reactive, with Mishra adding that their mindset has always been on offensive security to identify and address vulnerabilities in the evolving AI landscape. Repello AI ’s flagship product is ARTEMIS (Automated Red Teaming Engine for Mapping, Identification, and Scanning), which continuously runs millions of automated adversarial tests across text, image, and audio to deliver mitigation strategies to its customers. The other is Repello Guard, the company’s threat monitoring and guardrails solution, which provides runtime security for AI applications across modalities, detecting AI-specific threats such as unsafe output, competitor mentions, and system prompt leaks.When asked about cyberthreats getting stronger due to AI, Behera said it is \"a cat and mouse game.\" He said the defense side must learn from attacker techniques and use the attacker\\'s perspective to develop defensive strategies.Repello\\'s solutions are used by companies in India and some from the Fortune 500 as well. But North America is the largest market due to high AI adoption, but it has global customers in the Middle East as well.', 'embedding':

Once the redomiciling is completed, Bengaluru-based Meesho Ltd will become the parent entity.

Group\\'s vast energy and mining resources ensures a steady supply of raw materials at nominal costs, strengthening ACC\\'s competitive edge.The group also intends to increase the Master Supply Agreement (MSA) between Ambuja Cement and ACC for the supply of cement, clinker, and raw materials, which helps in the reduction of operational costs.\"Furthermore, we intend to maximise the value we create through synergies within the Adani ecosphere, MSA with the parent Ambuja Cements Limited and several strategic expansions of our business through the addition of raw material reserves, greenfield and brownfield growth,\" he said.Moreover, ACC is also embracing digitalisation and sustainability, integrating advanced technologies to enhance operational efficiency and pushing towards ESG targets.\"As we move forward, we remain committed to delivering exceptional value, driving innovation, and contributing meaningfully to India\\'s growth and progress,\" said Karan Adani.Adani

Byju's had paid $200 million in cash and stock to buy it in 2021. China's TAL Education Group paid $95 million for Epic, the kids learning platform that Byju's bought in 2021 through a $500 million cash-and-stock transaction.A third subsidiary, educational games company Osmo that Byju's took over for $120 million in 2019 in its first US acquisition, has also been put up for auction but is yet to find a buyer, a person familiar with the matter said.A US bankruptcy court approved the Tynker and Epic deals on May 20, as per a report by US-based publication EdWeek Market Brief. Bankruptcy attorney Claudia Springer has been managing the insolvency proceedings of Byju's subsidiaries in the US.The proceeds from the sale will be used to repay Byju's creditors. In June 2024, ET had reported that some lenders within a consortium that loaned $1.2 billion to Byju's had initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the three subsidiaries. Byju's didn't respond to an email seeking comment till press time Tuesday.Epic was Byju's second-biggest buyout after Indian coaching centre operator Aakash Institute, which the Bengaluru-based edtech firm acquired in 2021 for nearly $1 billion. Aakash Institute also separately raised $300 million from Ranjan Pai, chairman of Manipal Education and Medical Group, in 2023.The edtech firm, which was once valued at $22 billion, has acquired more than 15 companies, most of them during the Covid times of immediately after, driven by fast growing demand for online education. Founder Byju Raveendran had said that the $1.2 billion term loan the company secured from US lenders was used for both organic and inorganic international growth, including several acquisitions globally.On April 10, the lenders filed a lawsuit in the US against Raveendran , his wife Divya Gokulnath and former company executive Anita Kishore . The lawsuit alleged that the three of them planned and executed a scheme to hide and misappropriate $533 million from the money they had lent to Byju's Alpha, a special purpose financing vehicle the edtech company had established in the US to receive the loan. Prior to this, a bankruptcy court ruling indicated that multiple fraudulent transfers and theft had taken place.\", 'embedding': '[-0.04862189,-0.016255705,-0.010380605,-0.04971286,-0.015378371,-0.04137621,0.048066754,0.06709786,0.052469168,0.07632217,0.104783215,0.05934276,0.036438663,-0.021472774,0.03775006,0.030964885,0.034173008,-0.05831705,0.061157547,-0.039171644,-0.012760577,-0.065353535,-0.00054058875,-0.033155408,0.11548462,0.017814573,-0.055343088,-0.017126879,0.0013649265,-0.08989336,0.015007716,0.025728498,-0.013404187,0.02827205,0.013182966,0.0023680131,0.026096964,-0.009276491,-0.10856319,-0.0580678,-0.0018337369,0.03145422,-0.10263796,-0.0029237163,0.032353345,-0.023357974,-0.00024063651,-0.012045555,-0.00019164785,0.07226141,-0.070272796,-0.04853804,0.10252092,-0.03917106,-0.06985158,0.06624893,0.06896525,0.058130223,-0.019706126,0.014040322,0.009358878,-0.04391208,-0.038920898,-0.010218089,0.025513511,-0.027384086,0.027984986,0.087993704,-0.044871308,-0.07590259,0.10314338,-0.01879598,0.012403178,0.09274659,0.0061718845,0.029123448,0.082167044,0.018757505,0.06996585,-0.033779576,0.0521249,-0.05199479,-0.073366515,-0.04165178,-0.010512142,-0.006272877,0.017007887,0.10019215,0.12518995,0.017028423,-0.006291637,0.0055291653,0.06454604,0.053644437,-0.028578117,-0.059241425,0.005979648,0.09097562,-0.027349072,0.023299342,-0.0057079354,0.046386935,0.021242658,-0.07500381,-0.037024423,-0.029322494,0.05612556,0.02993211,0.13500264,0.010070689,-0.08516612,-0.0034808978,-0.01745607,0.020698555,0.0147877745,0.08519946,-0.06079797,0.06001628,0.06840989,-0.09843208,0.07140532,0.06441728,-0.05820853,-0.016290385,0.0013710782,-0.015415632,-0.07930289,2.3289645e-33,0.01408024,0.08858083,-0.036099356,0.02059885,-0.06086316,-0.0032803663,0.09496058,0.022478638,-0.12270197,0.024669418,-0.06285013,-0.043987922,-0.06169234,0.05328911,0.02946186,-0.12001075,-0.10341191,-0.026277427,0.06514613,0.018469637,0.003683045,0.019128943,-0.0062096743,0.007266688,0.015269621,-0.020471996,-0.0480555,0.001113323,0.13141203,0.018398203,0.011541683,-0.08459208,-0.018111674,0.028277665,0.0016935822,-0.012448034,-0.0063572195,-0.036631953,0.014191619,0.021160178,0.01431231,0.037076756,-0.0059999167,-0.017028682,-0.008585137,-0.018367283,0.013911117,-0.046970792,0.009301701,0.045077596,-0.05771699,0.008621258,-0.07681429,-0.033113927,-0.03269683,0.04613908,0.0035045529,-0.050734874,0.046717536,0.025413757,-0.009499746,-0.00571907,0.011093342,0.04484321,-0.122453414,0.06698333,0.07859741,-0.039593186,0.025107158,-0.04331432,-0.020818356,-0.047728408,0.05455324,0.031513464,-0.016156407,-0.026255675,0.009069537,0.006219207,0.02021325,-0.022831108,0.045204144,-0.07689028,0.0308344,0.016107384,0.0012605817,0.04616518,0.044015,-0.09632873,-0.050966118,-0.022269353,-0.03282629,-0.033819403,-0.023351226,0.034715656,0.068407685,-2.7038348e-33,-0.06091178,9.5222924e-05,-0.061563354,-0.018373016,0.007932751,-0.042654797,0.03884858,0.091351986,0.0090441,-0.010783824,-0.032330077,-0.037706185,-0.021020954,0.042665496,0.0019829276,-0.023133518,0.086783566,-0.0131519,0.06720248,-0.07997449,0.037230734,0.11222974,0.018625647,0.06079818,-0.0033949122,0.024076968,-0.015580721,0.00274012,0.08983204,0.11795883,0.07356352,-0.0053407094,0.025006339,0.07803716,0.0030758365,-0.017257305,0.021928094,-0.033129375,-0.059531648,0.0016250846,0.032579657,-0.05853128,-0.061890185,0.018632831,-0.0044581196,0.04829465,0.022532724,-0.041911278,0.041836906,0.04185954,0.03496387,-0.0042621843,0.04386764,-0.009261697,-0.06087784,9.49684e-05,0.023638528,-0.008701345,-0.07850165,-0.030689033,0.0480103,0.059428897,0.03812767,-0.045468066,-0.043515153,-0.008262846,0.018065674,0.0209989,-0.08630691,-0.109389514,-0.07328551,0.027284387,-0.047974527,-0.11136963,-0.0124548925,0.09223396,-0.1092359,0.040149484,0.021235138,-0.094915144,-0.047916163,0.050754897,0.07893083,0.0072099054,0.025723215,0.045185465,-0.013944642,-0.016730871,0.02295116,0.030082528,-0.07009891,-0.009432023,0.01882273,0.032266125,-0.034362588,-5.388554e-08,0.015079841,-0.010943322,0.032650806,-0.009996266,0.03489081,-0.033224262,0.02927348,0.096958965,0.05769341,0.08642253,-0.027197096,-0.01652421,-0.139727,-0.008332802,-0.031246116,0.00849588,-0.025825882,0.021628726,-0.043632116,-0.046660017,0.049785033,-0.0018660548,0.027193379,-0.01857163,-0.030378925,0.0009123797,-0.10009234,0.0429043,0.031806298,0.0060744956,-0.008028008,-0.018088216,0.019031182,-0.07800058,0.033550132,-0.08787459,-0.013878736,0.03352338,0.022346163,0.051212154,-0.041142207,-0.056297,0.03248477,0.025749417,0.0025840772,-0.019211551,-0.1485915,-0.10349097,0.10275095,-0.030389082,-0.009352344,-0.019627178,-0.08601837,-0.05628521,0.030329296,-0.030697737,-0.045735124,0.03533049,-0.02083593,0.017260572,0.037900485,-0.14388782,0.016624482,0.065312505]'}] count=None\n"

The products emerging from Raphe mPhibr are already making a tangible impact on the ground, signalling what we believe will be a monumental shift. Their work is not only accelerating India’s path to strategic self-reliance but also embodies the essence of our Global Resilience thesis at General Catalyst—building for a future that is secure, sovereign, and sustainable.”\n"

      "The Adani Group is targeting 100 GW energy generation capacity across thermal, renewable and pumped hydropower by 2030, chairman Gautam Adani said on Tuesday. This will include 31 GW capacity from Adani Power and 45 GW renewable energy from Adani Green Energy Group company Adani Energy Solutions , meanwhile, is implementing transmission projects worth ₹44,000 crore and smart metering projects of ₹13,600 crore, Adani said at an annual general meeting of shareholders of the group's flagship company Adani Enterprises The infrastructure and utilities conglomerate recorded a 7 per cent rise in revenue to ₹2.72 lakh crore in FY25 while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) increased over 8 per cent to ₹89,806 crore.Adani reiterated the group's capital expenditure plan of $15-$20 billion annually over the next five years. \"These are not just investments in our group, but investments in the possibilities for doing our part to build India's infrastructure,\" he said.The group's ports business-Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone-handled a record 450 metric million tonnes (mmt) cargo last fiscal year while Adani New Industries is set to open an integrated 10 GW solar module manufacturing facility by the next fiscal year.In the airports business, the company handled a record 94 million passengers while its greenfield airport in Navi Mumbai is set to start operations later this year with an initial capacity of 20 million passengers.Adani, though, termed the group's Dharavi rehabilitation project as its most transformative.\"...our most transformative project is unfolding in Dharavi - Asia's largest slum, now being reimagined as India's most ambitious urban rehabilitation project,\" he said. \"And over 1 million people will move from narrow lanes to a township that will feature spacious layouts, dual toilets, open spaces, schools, hospitals, transit hubs and parks,\" he said.Adani also said the group's governance is of global standards, referring to allegations from the US Department of Justice and the SEC. \"Despite all the noise, the facts are that no one from the Adani Group has been charged with violating the FCPA or conspiring to obstruct justice,\" he said. \"And as we cooperate with legal processes, let me also restate that our governance is of global standards, and our compliance frameworks are non-negotiable,\" he said.\n",

      "The cement industry will be a \"key enabler\" and is expected to benefit significantly from the approximately $2.2 trillion in investments projected in the infrastructure sector by 2030, said ACC Chairman Karan Adani ACC Cement , part of Adani Group 's cement business, which crossed the 100 MTPA capacity milestone in April 2025, is contributing to India's growth by laying a strong, sustainable foundation for a brighter tomorrow, said Adani in the latest annual report of the company.\"The infrastructure sector, vital to realising India's economic ambitions by 2030, is projected to require investments of approximately $2.2 trillion. As a key enabler of infrastructure growth, the cement industry stands to benefit significantly from these investments,\" he said while addressing the shareholders.The cement sector is set for significant expansion, and its strategic priorities are designed to leverage this potential effectively, he added.ACC is part of Ambuja Cement, which holds the billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Group's cement business.\"We crossed the 100 MTPA cement capacity milestone in April 2025, propelling us closer to our ambitious 140 MTPA target by FY 2027-28. As India's fastest-growing cement business, we are contributing to its growth by laying a strong, sustainable foundation for a brighter tomorrow,\" Karan Adani said.Moreover, he further said Adani Group's market leadership in various allied sectors is proving transformative for ACC, driving synergies across logistics, procurement, and market expansion.\"By leveraging the Group's extensive infrastructure, including ports, railways, and road networks, ACC has achieved significant cost efficiencies, streamlined operations, and enhanced delivery speed,\" he said.Moreover, access to Adani Group's vast energy and mining resources ensures a steady supply of raw materials at nominal costs, strengthening ACC's competitive edge.The group also intends to increase the Master Supply Agreement (MSA) between Ambuja Cement and ACC for the supply of cement, clinker, and raw materials, which helps in the reduction of operational costs.\"Furthermore, we intend to maximise the value we create through synergies within the Adani ecosphere, MSA with the parent Ambuja Cements Limited and several strategic expansions of our business through the addition of raw material reserves, greenfield and brownfield growth,\" he said.Moreover, ACC is also embracing digitalisation and sustainability, integrating advanced technologies to enhance operational efficiency and pushing towards ESG targets.\"As we move forward, we remain committed to delivering exceptional value, driving innovation, and contributing meaningfully to India's growth and progress,\" said Karan Adani.Adani Group, a late entrant in the cement sector, now contributes to nearly 30 per cent of the cement used for India's homes and infrastructure.The annual report expects growth to continue for the Indian cement sector , with a further increase of 6-7 per cent annually, to reach 475-480 million MT by FY 2025-26.The Indian cement sector has an installed capacity of 686 MT.\n",

      "Elon Musk ’s artificial intelligence startup xAI is burning through $1 billion a month as the cost of building its advanced AI models races ahead of the limited revenues, according to people briefed on the company’s financials.The rate at which the company is bleeding cash provides a stark illustration of the unprecedented financial demands of the artificial intelligence industry, particularly at xAI, where revenues have been slow to materialize.To cover the gap, Musk’s startup is currently trying to raise $9.3 billion in debt and equity, according to people briefed on the deal terms, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. But even before the money is in the bank, the company has plans to spend more than half of it in just the next three months, the people said.Over the course of 2025, xAI, which is responsible for the AI-powered chatbot Grok, expects to burn through about $13 billion, as reflected in the company’s levered cash flow, according to details shared with investors. As a result, its prolific fundraising efforts are just barely keeping pace with expenses, the people added.A spokesperson for the company declined to comment. However, Musk said “Bloomberg is talking nonsense” in a response to a post on his social media platform X that referenced Bloomberg’s article.The losses are due, in part, to the huge costs that all AI companies face as they build the server farms and buy the specialized computer chips that are needed to train advanced AI models like Grok and ChatGPT. Carlyle Group Inc. estimates that over $1.8 trillion of capital will be deployed by 2030 to meet that demand to build out AI infrastructure , Chief Executive Officer Harvey Schwartz wrote in a shareholder letter.“Model builders will look to raise debt and they’re going to burn lots and lots of cash,” said Jordan Chalfin, senior analyst and head of technology at CreditSights. “The space is very competitive and they are battling for technical supremacy.”But Musk’s entrant in the AI race has struggled to develop revenue streams at the same rate as some of its direct competitors, like OpenAI and Anthropic.While almost none of these companies offer public figures on their finances, Bloomberg has previously reported that OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is expecting to bring in revenues of $12.7 billion this year. At xAI, revenues are expected to be just $500 million this year, rising to north of $2 billion next year, investors were recently told.Listen and subscribe to Elon, Inc. on Apple, Spotify, iHeart and the Bloomberg Terminal.What xAI has on its side is a CEO, Musk, who is the richest man in the world, and one who has shown a willingness to spend his fortune on huge, futuristic projects long before they start generating money. Back in 2017, Musk’s biggest company, Tesla Inc. was burning through $1 billion a quarter to pay for the production of its Model 3 car, Bloomberg reported at the time. SpaceX, meanwhile, sustained years of steady losses as it pushed toward its long-term goal of interplanetary exploration. Even against this backdrop, though, the huge losses at xAI stand out.Musk’s team at xAI, which is racing to develop AI that can compete with humans, believes that they have advantages that will eventually allow them to catch up with peers. While some competitors rent chips and server space, xAI is paying for much of the infrastructure itself and getting direct access through X, which previously bought a significant stockpile of the most coveted and high powered computer chips. Musk has said that he expects xAI will continue buying more chips.After recently merging with X, Musk’s AI executives are also hopeful that they will be able to train the company’s models on the social media network’s copious and constantly-refreshed archives, rather than paying for data sets like other AI companies.These potential advantages have led xAI to optimistically project that it will be profitable by 2027, people familiar with the matter said. OpenAI expects to be cashflow positive by 2029, Bloomberg previously reported.These projections, along with Musk’s celebrity status and political power, have been enough to win over many investors, especially before the recent breakdown in the relationship between Musk and President Donald Trump. Potential xAI investors were told that the company’s valuation grew to $80 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $51 billion at the end of 2024. Investors have included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and VY Capital.For now, though, xAI is racing to raise enough money to keep up with its prodigious expenditures. Between its founding in 2023 and June of this year, xAI raised $14 billion of equity, people briefed on the financials said. Of that, just $4 billion was left at the beginning of the first quarter, and the company expected to spend almost all of that remaining money in the second quarter, the people said.The company is now finalizing $4.3 billion in new equity funding, and it already has plans to raise another $6.4 billion of capital next year, the company has told investors. And that is on top of the $5 billion in debt that Bloomberg has previously reported Morgan Stanley is helping it raise. The corporate debt is expected to help pay for xAI’s data center development, the people said. Other companies have decided to do project financing instead.The company is also expecting to get a bit of help from a $650 million rebate from one of its manufacturers, it told investors this week.There were early signs that investors were hesitant to loan the company money at the proposed terms, Bloomberg has reported. The company gave select investors more detailed financial information on Monday in response to questions it had faced during the fundraising process, people familiar with the negotiations said. But the deal has attracted more interest since the company changed some of the deal terms — to be more investor friendly — and finalized the equity fundraising.A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley, the bank in charge of xAI’s debt sale, declined to comment.\n",

      "Meesho could see the process of its redomiciling from the US to India conclude as early as this week, paving the way for filing draft papers for its initial public offering ( IPO ) this month, people aware of the developments said.The ecommerce marketplace is targeting a $700-800 million IPO, but the issue size and the timelines could change depending on the market conditions, one of the persons said.\"Meesho's flip back process will close in a few days and it will be ready to file its IPO papers as early as next week, but that could get stretched to sometime later this month,\" the person said.It is likely to file its draft papers under the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) confidential route, the person added.The company earlier this week converted itself to a public entity - a key step that firms take on their path to going public. Once the redomiciling is completed, Bengaluru-based Meesho Ltd will become the parent entity. The firm had sought the National Company Law Tribunal's approval for a reverse merger in January when it closed a $550-million funding round that saw Tiger Global , Mars Growth Capital and Think Investments among others join its cap table.This transaction, which was largely a secondary deal, valued the company at around $3.9-4 billion, a discount from its peak valuation of $5 billion. Kotak Mahindra Capital, Citi, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have been appointed as merchant bankers for Meesho's public issue, people cited above said.\n",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI)-backed security solutions startup Repello has raised $1.2 million in seed funding, with Venture Highway, Pi Ventures, and Entrepreneur First participating in the round. Angel investors, including Meta board member Charles Songhurst, Sarvam AI CEO Vivek Raghavan, and Satya Vas, have also backed the company in the round.Repello defends generative AI (GenAI) systems by using its products to simulate real-world attacks to find vulnerabilities and provide next steps for mitigation and safeguarding.Established in 2024 by IIT Roorkee alumni Aryaman Behera and Naman Mishra, Repello's engineering, product, and R&D teams are based in Bengaluru, while sales and marketing verticals are in San Francisco. The company plans to use the funding to accelerate product development and expand the platform's red teaming and threat intelligence capabilities and to scale its go-to-market efforts, Behera told ET.\"We are also working on strategic partnerships and integrations to fuel the company's growth,\" he said.Behera affirmed the startup's belief in a proactive stance to cybersecurity, rather than reactive, with Mishra adding that their mindset has always been on offensive security to identify and address vulnerabilities in the evolving AI landscape. Repello AI ’s flagship product is ARTEMIS (Automated Red Teaming Engine for Mapping, Identification, and Scanning), which continuously runs millions of automated adversarial tests across text, image, and audio to deliver mitigation strategies to its customers. The other is Repello Guard, the company’s threat monitoring and guardrails solution, which provides runtime security for AI applications across modalities, detecting AI-specific threats such as unsafe output, competitor mentions, and system prompt leaks.When asked about cyberthreats getting stronger due to AI, Behera said it is \"a cat and mouse game.\" He said the defense side must learn from attacker techniques and use the attacker's perspective to develop defensive strategies.Repello's solutions are used by companies in India and some from the Fortune 500 as well. But North America is the largest market due to high AI adoption, but it has global customers in the Middle East as well.\n",
